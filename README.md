This is a repository to showcase the advanced features of claude code.
It will not use any other AI coding tools, only claude.

Always:
- be succinct and concise - the user does not want to wade through pages of words, they want to see the purpose and learn from it as quickly and efficiently as possible
- don't repeat yourself - if something already exists, don't repeat it in different words. this is very important to keep the complexity of this project as low as possible.
- make it simple - don't use complicated wordings or overly complex or long sentences. it should be easy to understand and obvious what it does
- describe - this repo should be a learning resource and a playground. describe what is what, why it exists, and how to use it
- commit often - after every meaningful step, automatically git commit the changes. write succinct but meaningful commit messages
- test often - try to run a test suite after code changes, to catch bugs and errors early on

This repo will include:
- CLAUDE.md
- .claude/commands
- .claude/skills
- .claude/agents (or should it be called subagents?)
- .claude/hooks
- mcp servers
- tools
- models: sonnet and haiku, maybe opus - when to use which
- .md and .yml files - when to use what
- structured markdown (e.g. start with a --- key-value-pairs --- section for description and meta-info, then headings of different levels to describe everything)
- context management
- workflows
- tests
- specs
- project documentation
- and so on
